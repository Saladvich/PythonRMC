Read the hashtag notes (#s) in python file. The x_ValuesBook.xlsx should not be moved or changed nor should the excel path or columns in the code. You only need to change the parameter values When the code is run, the values will be printed in this excel sheet for your needs. µ min and ranges are printed in the python IDE. At the beginning of each run, the data corresponding to µ will all be wiped.
